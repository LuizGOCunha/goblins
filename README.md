This repo contains a simulation of a Goblin Society, it is an ongoing project and this document should be updated if any changes occur.

Notes: 
- To run the simulation one should execute the `main.py` file.
- To change the objects and locations to be simulated one should edit the `main.py` directly.
- Everything occurs within a map instance that is generated directly on the `libraries.map` lib.
- At the moment only Goblins are being simulated, more creatures to be added in the future.
- Goblins roam, yell at others and attack if sufficiently irritated.
